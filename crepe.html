                    A crêpe or crepe is a type of very thin pastry. Crêpes are usually of two types: sweet crêpes and savoury galettes. Crêpes
                    are served with a variety of fillings, from the simplest with only sugar to flambéed crêpes Suzette or
                    elaborate savoury galettes. While crêpes are often associated with Brittany, a region in the northwest
                    of France, their consumption is widespread in France, Belgium, Canada, and many parts of Europe, North
                    Africa, and the Southern Cone of South America. Sweet crêpes are generally made with wheat flour (farine
                    de froment). When sweet, they can be eaten as part of breakfastor as a dessert. Common fillings include Nutella spread, preserves,
                    sugar (granulated or powdered), maple syrup, golden syrup, lemon juice, whipped cream, fruit spreads, custard,
                    and sliced soft fruits or confiture. Savory crêpes are made with non-wheat flours such as buckwheat.
                    Batter made from buckwheat flour is gluten-free, which makes it possible for people who have a gluten
                    allergy or intolerance to eat this type of crêpe. Common savoury fillings for crêpes served for lunch or dinner are
                    cheese, ham, and eggs, ratatouille, mushrooms, artichoke (in certain regions), and various meat products.
                    Batters can also consist of other simple ingredients such as butter, milk, water, eggs, flour, salt,
                    and sugar. Fillings are commonly added to the centre of the crêpe and served with the edges partially
                    folded over the centre. A crêperie may be a takeaway restaurant or stall, serving crêpes as a form of
                    fast food or street food, or may be a more formal sit-down restaurant or café. Crêperies are typical
                    of Brittany in France; however, crêperies can be found throughout France and in many other countries.
                    Because a crêpe may be served as both a main meal or a dessert, crêperies may be quite diverse in their
                    selection and may offer other baked goods such as baguettes. They may also serve coffee, tea, buttermilk,
                    and cider (a popular drink to accompany crêpes)

                Ratatouille is another globally known French dish, hailing from the southeastern French region of Provence. It is a stewed
                vegetable recipe that can be served as a side dish, meal or stuffing for other dishes, such as crepes and
                omelettes. The vegetables are generally first cooked in a shallow pan on high heat with a small amount of
                fat, and then oven-baked in a dish. French chefs debate the correct way to cook ratatouille: some do not
                agree with sauteing all vegetables together, such as Julia Child, and argue the vegetables should be cooked
                separately and layered into the baking dish. The ingredients consist of tomatoes, garlic, onions, zucchini,
                eggplant, carrots, bell peppers, basil, marjoram, thyme and other green herbs, such as Provence herbs. A
                similar dish popular in the French Basque country is piperade, which typically adds ham and sometimes eggs
                to the stewed vegetable mix. In Pixar's 2007 animated film Ratatouille, Remy, Linguini, and Colette cook
                a variation of ratatouille called confit byaldi to impress a restaurant critic.

                Coq au vin is a French dish of chicken braised with wine, lardons, mushrooms, and optionally garlic. A red Burgundywine is
                typically used, though many regions of France make variants using local varietals, such as coq au vin jaune (Jura),
                coq au Riesling (Alsace), coq au pourpre or coq au violet(Beaujolais nouveau), coq au Champagne, etc. Although
                the word "coq" in French means "rooster" or "cock", and tough birds with lots of connective tissue benefit
                from braising, most modern coq au vin recipes simply call for commercially produced chicken which may be
                male or female. Standard recipes call for red wine (often Burgundy) for braising, lardons, button mushrooms,
                onions, often garlic, and sometimes brandy. Recipes with vin jaune may specify morels instead of white mushrooms.
                The preparation is similar in many respects to beef bourguignon. The chicken is seasoned, sometimes floured,
                seared in fat and slowly simmered in wine until tender. The usual seasonings are salt, pepper, thyme, parsley
                and bay leaf, usually in the form of a bouquet garni. The juices are thickened either with a roux or by adding blood at
                the end.
