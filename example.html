                A baguette is a long, thin loaf of French bread that is commonly made from basic lean dough (the dough, though not the shape,
                is defined by French law). It is distinguishable by its length and crisp crust. A baguette has a diameter
                of about 5 or 6 centimetres (2 or 2⅓ in) and a usual length of about 65 centimetres (26 in), although a baguette
                can be up to a metre (39 in) long. The "baguette de tradition française" is made from wheat flour, water,
                yeast, and common salt. It may contain up to 2% broad bean flour, up to 0.5% soya flour, and up to 0.3% wheat
                malt flour. While a regular baguette is made with a direct addition of baker's yeast, it is not unusual for
                artisan-style loaves to be made with a pre-ferment ("poolish") to increase flavor complexity and other characteristics,
                as well as the addition of whole-wheat flour, or other grains such as rye. Baguettes are closely connected
                to France, though they are made around the world. In France, not all long loaves are baguettes; for example,
                a short, almost rugby ball shaped loaf is a bâtard (literally, bastard), or a "torpedo loaf" in English;
                its origin is variously explained, but undocumented. Another tubular shaped loaf is known as a flûte, also
                known in the United States as a parisienne. Flûtes closely resemble baguettes and weigh more or less than
                these, depending on the region. A thinner loaf is called a ficelle (string). A short baguette is sometimes
                known as a baton (stick), or even referred to using the English translation French stick. None of these are
                officially defined, either legally or, for instance, in major dictionaries, any more than the baguette. French
                breads are also made in forms such as a miche, which is a large pan loaf, and a boule, literally ball in
                French, a large round loaf. Sandwich-sized loaves are sometimes known as demi-baguettes or tiers.

                Ratatouille is another globally known French dish, hailing from the southeastern French region of Provence. It is a stewed
                vegetable recipe that can be served as a side dish, meal or stuffing for other dishes, such as crepes and
                omelettes. The vegetables are generally first cooked in a shallow pan on high heat with a small amount of
                fat, and then oven-baked in a dish. French chefs debate the correct way to cook ratatouille: some do not
                agree with sauteing all vegetables together, such as Julia Child, and argue the vegetables should be cooked
                separately and layered into the baking dish. The ingredients consist of tomatoes, garlic, onions, zucchini,
                eggplant, carrots, bell peppers, basil, marjoram, thyme and other green herbs, such as Provence herbs. A
                similar dish popular in the French Basque country is piperade, which typically adds ham and sometimes eggs
                to the stewed vegetable mix. In Pixar's 2007 animated film Ratatouille, Remy, Linguini, and Colette cook
                a variation of ratatouille called confit byaldi to impress a restaurant critic.

                Coq au vin is a French dish of chicken braised with wine, lardons, mushrooms, and optionally garlic. A red Burgundywine is
                typically used, though many regions of France make variants using local varietals, such as coq au vin jaune (Jura),
                coq au Riesling (Alsace), coq au pourpre or coq au violet(Beaujolais nouveau), coq au Champagne, etc. Although
                the word "coq" in French means "rooster" or "cock", and tough birds with lots of connective tissue benefit
                from braising, most modern coq au vin recipes simply call for commercially produced chicken which may be
                male or female. Standard recipes call for red wine (often Burgundy) for braising, lardons, button mushrooms,
                onions, often garlic, and sometimes brandy. Recipes with vin jaune may specify morels instead of white mushrooms.
                The preparation is similar in many respects to beef bourguignon. The chicken is seasoned, sometimes floured,
                seared in fat and slowly simmered in wine until tender. The usual seasonings are salt, pepper, thyme, parsley
                and bay leaf, usually in the form of a bouquet garni. The juices are thickened either with a roux or by adding blood at
                the end.
