                    Foie gras (French for "fat liver") is a luxury food product made of the liver of a duck or goose that has been specially
                    fattened. By French law, foie gras is defined as the liver of a duck or goose fattened by force-feeding corn
                    with a feeding tube, a process also known as gavage. In Spain and other countries, it is occasionally
                    produced using natural feeding. Ducks are force-fed twice a day for 12.5 days and geese three times a
                    day for around 17 days. Ducks are typically slaughtered at 100 days and geese at 112 days. Foie gras
                    is a popular and well-known delicacy in French cuisine. Its flavor is described as rich, buttery, and
                    delicate, unlike that of an ordinary duck or goose liver. Foie gras is sold whole, or is prepared into mousse, parfait,
                    or pâté, and may also be served as an accompaniment to another food item, such as steak. French law states
                    that "Foie gras belongs to the protected cultural and gastronomical heritage of France." The technique
                    of gavage dates as far back as 2500 BC, when the ancient Egyptians began keeping birds for food and deliberately
                    fattened the birds through force-feeding. Today, France is by far the largest producer and consumer of
                    foie gras, though it is produced and consumed worldwide, particularly in other European nations, the
                    United States, and China. Gavage-based foie gras production is controversial, due mainly to the animal
                    welfare concerns about force-feeding, intensive housing and husbandry, and enlarging the liver to 10
                    times its usual volume. A number of countries and jurisdictions have laws against force-feeding, and
                    the production, import or sale of foie gras; even where it is legal, a number of retailers decline to
                    stock it.

                Ratatouille is another globally known French dish, hailing from the southeastern French region of Provence. It is a stewed
                vegetable recipe that can be served as a side dish, meal or stuffing for other dishes, such as crepes and
                omelettes. The vegetables are generally first cooked in a shallow pan on high heat with a small amount of
                fat, and then oven-baked in a dish. French chefs debate the correct way to cook ratatouille: some do not
                agree with sauteing all vegetables together, such as Julia Child, and argue the vegetables should be cooked
                separately and layered into the baking dish. The ingredients consist of tomatoes, garlic, onions, zucchini,
                eggplant, carrots, bell peppers, basil, marjoram, thyme and other green herbs, such as Provence herbs. A
                similar dish popular in the French Basque country is piperade, which typically adds ham and sometimes eggs
                to the stewed vegetable mix. In Pixar's 2007 animated film Ratatouille, Remy, Linguini, and Colette cook
                a variation of ratatouille called confit byaldi to impress a restaurant critic.

                Coq au vin is a French dish of chicken braised with wine, lardons, mushrooms, and optionally garlic. A red Burgundywine is
                typically used, though many regions of France make variants using local varietals, such as coq au vin jaune (Jura),
                coq au Riesling (Alsace), coq au pourpre or coq au violet(Beaujolais nouveau), coq au Champagne, etc. Although
                the word "coq" in French means "rooster" or "cock", and tough birds with lots of connective tissue benefit
                from braising, most modern coq au vin recipes simply call for commercially produced chicken which may be
                male or female. Standard recipes call for red wine (often Burgundy) for braising, lardons, button mushrooms,
                onions, often garlic, and sometimes brandy. Recipes with vin jaune may specify morels instead of white mushrooms.
                The preparation is similar in many respects to beef bourguignon. The chicken is seasoned, sometimes floured,
                seared in fat and slowly simmered in wine until tender. The usual seasonings are salt, pepper, thyme, parsley
                and bay leaf, usually in the form of a bouquet garni. The juices are thickened either with a roux or by adding blood at
                the end.
