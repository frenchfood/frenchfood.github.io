                    Ratatouille is another globally known French dish, hailing from the southeastern French region of Provence. It is a stewed
                    vegetable recipe that can be served as a side dish, meal or stuffing for other dishes, such as crepes
                    and omelettes. The vegetables are generally first cooked in a shallow pan on high heat with a small amount
                    of fat, and then oven-baked in a dish. French chefs debate the correct way to cook ratatouille: some
                    do not agree with sauteing all vegetables together, such as Julia Child, and argue the vegetables should
                    be cooked separately and layered into the baking dish. The ingredients consist of tomatoes, garlic, onions,
                    zucchini, eggplant, carrots, bell peppers, basil, marjoram, thyme and other green herbs, such as Provence
                    herbs. A similar dish popular in the French Basque country is piperade, which typically adds ham and
                    sometimes eggs to the stewed vegetable mix. In Pixar's 2007 animated film Ratatouille, Remy, Linguini,
                    and Colette cook a variation of ratatouille called confit byaldi to impress a restaurant critic.

                Coq au vin is a French dish of chicken braised with wine, lardons, mushrooms, and optionally garlic. A red Burgundywine is
                typically used, though many regions of France make variants using local varietals, such as coq au vin jaune (Jura),
                coq au Riesling (Alsace), coq au pourpre or coq au violet(Beaujolais nouveau), coq au Champagne, etc. Although
                the word "coq" in French means "rooster" or "cock", and tough birds with lots of connective tissue benefit
                from braising, most modern coq au vin recipes simply call for commercially produced chicken which may be
                male or female. Standard recipes call for red wine (often Burgundy) for braising, lardons, button mushrooms,
                onions, often garlic, and sometimes brandy. Recipes with vin jaune may specify morels instead of white mushrooms.
                The preparation is similar in many respects to beef bourguignon. The chicken is seasoned, sometimes floured,
                seared in fat and slowly simmered in wine until tender. The usual seasonings are salt, pepper, thyme, parsley
                and bay leaf, usually in the form of a bouquet garni. The juices are thickened either with a roux or by adding blood at
                the end.
